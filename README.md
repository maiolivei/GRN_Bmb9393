# Abstract

_Staphylococcus aureus_ is one of the most prevalent and relevant pathogens responsible for a wide spectrum of hospital-associated or community-acquired infections. In addition, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ may display multidrug resistance profiles that complicate treatment and increase the mortality rate. The ability to produce biofilm, particularly in device-associated infections, promotes chronic and potentially more severe infections originating from the primary site. Understanding the complex mechanisms involved in planktonic and biofilm growth is critical to identifying regulatory connections and ways to overcome the global health problem of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this work, we apply literature-based and comparative genomics approaches to reconstruct the gene regulatory network of the high biofilm-producing strain Bmb9393, belonging to one of the highly disseminating successful clones, the Brazilian epidemic clone. For the first time, we describe the topological properties and identified network motifs for a _Staphylococcus aureus_ gene regulatory network. In addition, we analyzed transcriptomes available in the literature to construct a set of genes differentially expressed in the biofilm, covering different stages of the biofilms and genetic backgrounds of the strains. The Bmb9393 gene regulatory network comprises 1,803 regulatory interactions between 64 transcription factors and the non-redundant set of 1,151 target genes with the inclusion of 19 new regulons compared to the N315 transcriptional regulatory network published in 2011. In the Bmb9393 network, we found 54 feed-forward loop motifs, where the most prevalent were coherent type 2 and incoherent type 2. The non-redundant set of differentially expressed genes in the biofilm consisted of 1,794 genes with functional categories relevant for adaptation to the variable microenvironments established throughout the biofilm formation process. Finally, we mapped the set of genes with altered expression in the biofilm in the Bmb8383 gene regulatory network to depict how different growth modes can alter the regulatory systems. The data revealed 45 transcription factors and 876 shared target genes. Thus, the gene regulatory network model provided represents the most up-to-date model for Staphylococcus aureus, and the set of genes altered in the biofilm provides a global view of their influence on biofilm formation from distinct experimental perspectives and different strain backgrounds.
